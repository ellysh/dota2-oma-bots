# Dota 2 OMA Bots 0.8 version

*This project is still in a developing stage.*

These are Objective-Moves-Actions (OMA) bots for Dota 2 and a toolkit to configure them.

A current development state is available in the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Concept

The idea of the bot is deciding on the required action on several levels. The first level is choosing an objective to reach (for example killing an enemy hero). The second level is selecting an appropriate move to achieve the objective (for example use silence ability first for preventing healing items). Then the last step is performing actions, which compose the selected move. The bot performs the most appropriate move until the chosen objective is not reached.

## Usage

There are steps to start playing with the bot:

1. Create a lobby.
2. Choose the "1v1 Solo Mid" game mode.
3. Choose the OMA bots for both sides.
4. Start a game.
5. Pick Drow Ranger.

## Limitations

Now you should follow the following limitations when playing with the bot:

1. Pick only Drow Ranger hero.
2. No wards.
3. No shrines.
4. No neutral camps.
5. No Roshan.
6. No Glyph.
7. Bot difficulty is Hard or above.
